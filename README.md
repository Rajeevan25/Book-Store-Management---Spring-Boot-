# Book-Store-Management---Spring-Boot-
This project is a simple Book Store Management System built using Spring Boot and MySQL. It allows users to manage books in a store, including operations like:

Adding new books

Viewing available books

Updating book details

Deleting books

Searching books by title, author, or category

The system is designed with a clean RESTful API structure and uses Spring Data JPA for database interactions. MySQL is used as the relational database to store book records.
